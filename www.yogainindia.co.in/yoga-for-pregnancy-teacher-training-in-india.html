			<td style="text-align: justify;">Yoga is said to be an ideal preparation for labor and birth. It is also an excellent way to get back into shape after birth. The reason for this lies in yoga&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp;<br />
			In yoga the body is eased into alignment with the awareness of breath. And performing yoga poses with awareness creates a state of calmness. When a pregnant women feels inner clarity, her confidence grows. When she feels peaceful, her anxiety concerning the birth process decreases.<br />
			The mind becomes involved in the body movements. This focus allows the pregnant women to tune out the distracting forces around her during labor and to respond appropriately to the contractions.</td>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoga provides a way to refine the movements of body. When first performing the poses, lady may feel slightly awkward and stiff. After practicing them over and over again, the body will stretch, adapt and gradually move into alignment. This is invaluable training, for labor is&nbsp;a very physical process. Knowing where you are tight or weak, and working on those areas, will help prepare the body for birth.<br />
Hence, Prenatal(Yoga before birth) and Postnatal(Yoga after birth) Yoga helps to adjust the physical demands of labor, birth, and motherhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pregnancy Yoga is divided normally in two stages nowadays - Prenatal Yoga(Yoga before child&#39;s birth) and Postnatal Yoga(Yoga after child&#39;s birth). But in our Vedic Indian Tradition, it had been divided in 3 stages - Yoga before Pregnancy, during pregnancy and after pregnancy.</strong>&nbsp;So, we at Om Yoga under Prenatal Yoga teach it in two stages - Yoga before Pregnancy and during Pregnancy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Yoga Before Pregnancy:</strong> has been given a lot of importance in our Vedic culture. It is seen nowadays, people give birth to child without being fully prepared. Educated people still have started thinking about this but uneducated or unaware people have only focus on giving birth to children. But our Vedas says before Pregnancy, the parents should ponder upon various things: 1. Are they both&nbsp;fully prepared for child or not? 2. Are both physically as well as mentally healthy? 3. What type of mental level they want&nbsp;for their child? To have a child, first both parents must be ready from inside to have the child. If anyone of them is not ready, it is better to wait. And also they must have a clear mindset about what type of mental level&nbsp;they wish for the child? Before going for conceiving, first both should consult a doctor about their physical well being and must focus on&nbsp;their mental well being. Because at time of conceiving, physical and mental level of both plays a great role. If anyone of them feel physically or mentally they are not healthy, it is better to wait for some time first and when they feel are fully realxed, then must go on for child. Because if any of the parent is not physically or mentally healthy, so child also suffers. So, Yoga before Pregnancy is very very important.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Yoga During Pregnancy:</strong>&nbsp;Now&nbsp;comes the time when lady conceives, these days are still more crucial for both of them. Because this time lady suffers from many physical and mental challenges. Here both of them needs to pay a much more attention than before. As our Vedas says the child learns many things inside the mother&#39;s womb. For this, many expamples have been cited in our Vedas which we teach in our course like Ashtavakra(who had taken all the knowledge of vedas&nbsp;inside mother&#39;s womb from his father and after coming out, had given the great teaching of ashtavakra geeta to great king Janaka Ji), and King Kans who was son of very religious parents but when he was in his mother&#39;s womb, one day she was taking a walk in the garden outside, but unfortunately, the same time demon Durmil was also present there and his shadow fall upon his mother which had a great impact on the child present inside that made him a such a cruel king when he came on this planet and like this many more. From this it is clear how atmosphere affects the child inside. Good atmosphere also affects and bad atmosphere also affects. So, mother needs to take a lot of care in these days. Specially, what type of mental level you require for your child, are you giving him that atmosphere or not? It is very important to have a look that time.&nbsp;Each and every action of a mother affects her child. Her good thinking also affects and her bad thinking also affects her child. Her good actions or bad actions also put affect on her child. Like doctor says mother&#39;s physical health decides the physical health of a child. Similarly, her mental health also affects the mental state of her child. So, lifestyle of a mother is of utmost importance. It is seen nowadays, people do think before for a child that are they prepared or not? But during the pregnancy this thing is not taken in account. Even eduated parents fail in this. Very rare people are seen who knows about it. That how the physical and mental level of mother affects the physical and mental level of her child.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to be aware&nbsp;what type of lifestyle is good for a mother? What should be her mental level? What type of people stay around you? For ex., you want your child to be a good&nbsp;person with positive thinking, not of disturbed mind, very intelligent,&nbsp;but mother in those days stays in an environement where every moment there are fights, negative people stay around, speaking lies, cheating others. So acc. to the thinking you had for your child you are unable to provide him a compatible atmosphere. This results is having a bad effect upon your child. So, this child will learn many negative things instead of positive things inside the womb itself.&nbsp;So, if you want your child should be a good person, mother should think good, stay around more nice people. These things are very important. Ofcourse practice of some required asanas , pranayama or meditation helps to relax the mind and be prepared for normal delivery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our course helps the mother to be ready for pain the delivery process. Nowadays, delivery is done through two ways: one is normal delivery and another is through C-Section. Normal delivery is ofcourse the better one and every lady wants to go through this stage. But this fact very much depends upon what type of life she has been living in the previous 9 months or whatever time. In this, Yoga has a lot of impact. Yoga with the help of many breathing and relaxation and meditation techniques prepares the mother for normal deivery rather than c-section. This also helps her to bear the pain she faces at that time. As this is tme most tough time for the lady because it is said the pain that oocurs to a lady at this time is equal to thw bite of 100 scorpions. So, this is very painful. By daily practicing yogic kriyas, she becomes physically and mentally strong that she learns to manage it. We here at Om Yoga teach many different yogic techniques which help her to go through the stage of normal delivery only.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Yoga After Pregnancy:</strong>&nbsp;Now comes the time when your child has come in this world. Here, again many things accounts. Giving proper care to the child, giving him a good environment what you desire for him. Keeping yourself physically and mentally healthy is again very important. Because if now again mother is not physically or mentally relaxed, aloong with her, her child also suffers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This Yoga for Pregnancy Teacher Training Course has a duration of total 30days (4&nbsp;weeks). This course is very effective for ladies specially. And&nbsp;Yoga is very much required&nbsp;to have a complete knowledge about the birth process of a child. &nbsp;<strong>We at OM YOGA tell the ancient techniques followed by our sages for upbringing their children</strong> right from the time they were not even in the mothers womb. From the time they were prepared to have a child till the time the child was born and even later upto he grew. This is the main speciality followed at our center to guide the pregnancy timing.</p>

I had a habit of taking drugs but after studying the course, i really changed my habits to Sattvic. Also, what we all use to feel that happiness is something that comes from outer world. Here, I learned what is true happiness? Now, i can say and can feel that i am very happy and can feel happiness from inside  and doesnot require outer things to keep me happy.</p>

Before 5 years, i suffered from Diabetes and due to this, i underwent a lot of stress. i could feel everytime i use to hide my real self. I could never express myself the way i am. This very thing always made me feel not good. After completing the yoga course, i was able to recognise and accept real me and could question myself as a neutral person. This was so superb that i started dealing with my problems so nicely. This was the first thing that helped me here to overcome my stress. The best lesson i learned in my Yoga course is Aparigraha. Have as much required. Ask yourself how much you require rather than working unconsciously.  I was able to manage my stress effectively.I was deeply benefitted by this program as i learned the right way of living a life.</p>

The best part of this course was i could meet Ruchika Sensei, whose lessons had a great impact on my mind. It was great and fantastic to take lectures of her.

Here, I learnt how body, mind and breath are connected with each other. Yoga is not merely asanas. Doing asanas, by connecting mind with body helps in achieving better pose.  I learnt from here,"“Don’t make the problem bigger by yourself.” This is what I learned from teacher Ruchika Saran. “Be satisfied with what you have now.” “You become far from happiness if you are focusing on past or future.”
“Find happiness from where you are, be responsible for yourself, choose to be better.” These are golden things i have learned from here.

                    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>I was very happy to learn Yoga Philosophy so deeply. I feel myself fortunate because the beginning of my yoga course was in Om Yoga!! I feel it was my best choice that i started my yoga course here. As i learnt everything in a traditional way. At some parts i feel more different asana practice can be set up in the course rather than repeating asanas everyday. </p>

          <div class="about-footer pb-3">
<div class="footer-logo" style="text-align:justify"><strong>OM YOGA &ndash; believes in making complete and perfect Yoga Instructor acc. to Yoga of Indian Traditiion.</strong> So, if you are looking for becoming a complete and perfect Yoga instructor, then you are at a right place. Yoga which was born in India in Sanskrit language many centuries before whose date and time cannot be specified as it is present since the beginning of this universe, whose base was Ashtanga Yoga and Hatha Yoga written in Patanjali Yog Darshan, Hatha Yog Pradipika, Gheranda Samhita, Siva Samhita etc. is a very deep knowledge like an ocean. It is so deep that nothing in this world is impossible with Yoga. The impossible word here signifies whatever requirements human being has in this world like respect, position, health, wealth, success, love, beauty, fearless, physically and mentally strong, peace, bliss, in overall all achievements on this planet that human being wants to have , there is nothing that cannot be achieved through Yoga. &nbsp;<strong>There is no word like Impossible with Yoga because Yoga means UNION which means becoming one. And this is practically experienced by our Yogis.</strong> And this is the reason why people travel to India to study Yoga specifically as India has gained its special position in this world with the name of Yoga, and has also been declared as, &rdquo;World Guru&rdquo;.<br />
But, we can see that in this present time there are more than thousands of Yoga centres all over the India who say that they teach Yoga but seeing in reality, we can feel and see that traditional yoga is getting lost because modern people who are coming forth in this field themselves have no actual understanding about Yoga as they cannot study Sanskrit language so, unable to understand real Yoga. So, these people have restricted the meaning of Yoga only to Asanas. After Asanas, people do not go beyond because they do not there is something beyond this also. Which is totally wrong. Yoga is something different. It is a complete path in itself. Asanas is just one part of Yoga but not a complete path. So, it can be seen Yoga has just become a fun in present time. If we talk to people for Yoga, they have only two things to speak about, one is regarding Asanas and another how to cure diseases that is therapy. Nothing beyond this. So, it is very pathetic to see how Yoga is loosing its real meaning.<br />
<strong>We, here at Om Yoga focus on this real Indian Traditional Yoga along with Sanskrit language present the same to people in English.</strong>(we have facilities for the translator for those people who have problem in understanding English). This makes our place unique place to study Yoga which is rarely available in other places. And we have succeded in achieving 99% results in spreading this knowledge. Our students feel this thing after they come to Om Yoga. They say that they had no idea Yoga is something beyond asanas also. They understand the real meaning of Yoga here and specially come to teach Traditional Yogic concepts here with us. And feel happy while they leave the centre. Our Traditional Yogic concepts help them in changing their life and come out of stress. For more info, you can visit our page of <a href="yoga-student-review.html">STUDENT REVIEWS</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>We can see that present time has become a very struggle full time for human being to survive on this planet because of increasing competition and desires and instability in relationships and emotions.</strong> To fulfil his desires and to be ahead in the race of competition, he is working day to night to achieve that and has just become like a machine where he has just forgotted the words like happiness, joy, calmness, relaxation etc.. But still when he is unable to fulfil his desires, he feels unsatisfied. Because if seen in reality, there is no end to desires. Desires are unlimited and no one ever can make the desires fulfilled. But we never understand this and are keen on fulfilling them. And when unable to fulfil, feel sad and unsatisfied, Because of that he gets demoralized and turns negative. This negative thinking then brings him under peer pressure feeling himself responsible for not being able to do what he wants. This then results in a lot of stress, tension, depression and anxiety. Now, when he is full of stress and anxiety, unable to sleep properly, then to come out of all this, he chooses an other path to make mind calm. For that, he starts taking a drink, smoke, drugs etc... Slowly and gradually, he becomes addicted to all this. The result of all this is that the person then suffers physically also. Because this path is not a permanent and correct way to get out of stress. But, because of lack of understanding at that time, he is unable to understand all this. So, he suffers from physical and mental illness. And hence his entire life is ruined.<br />
<strong>We, here with the help of Asanas and Pranayama help the person to recover from physical illness</strong> and become physically strong and is a preparation for becoming mentally strong. <strong>And with the help of our Yogic Philosophy, we help to recover from mental illness by changing the perspective of thinking for life.</strong> This helps them to have a positive look at life AND BE HAPPY and real solution to all the problems of life by his own. So, he becomes mentally strong. And we are happy to say that we have achieved 100% results in this. Because students who come to study at our centre, have experienced it and benefitted from this and have learned the, &rdquo;ART OF LIVING&rdquo; at our centre. <strong>This is what is real Yoga, that teaches us ART OF LIVING.</strong><br />
<strong>So, if you are really looking for this studies of real Yoga, you are invited to join us and get benefitted and spread the real knowledge to others also. Studying here helps you to gain more confidence at your knowledge and spread the right and useful knowledge amongst others.</strong></div>
