                <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>11 DAYS 50 HOUR KUNDALINI YOGA TTC IN RISHIKESH - HARIDWAR, INDIA</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTE: We also provide with EMI Facility for credit card (ICICI, HDFC, HSBC, Axis, Standard Chatrered, Yes, Kotak, Ratnakar Bank ) for indians who want to undergo the course at our centre.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kundalini Yoga is said to be a part of Hatha Yoga which was introduced by Lord Shiva and further introduced by Guru Gorakhnath Ji and later Swami Swataram Ji. Till now, Kundalini Yoga was known by the name of Hatha Yoga. Further in 1968, Yogi Bhajan introduced his own brand of kundalini yoga into the United States, &quot;Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan&quot;. But the techniques used were same as of Hatha Yoga.<br />
<br />
Before Yogi Bhajan introduced his own way of Kundalini Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Kundalini Yoga were considered to be same. People use to know Kundalini Yoga by the names of Hatha Yoga. All the techniques of Hatha Yoga focus on activating the Kundalini. And for Kundalini energy to flow freely, your body must be in harmony. The way to achieve this harmony begins with practicing Hatha yoga. Hatha yoga postures and breathing exercises promote balance in your body.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As written in our Vedas, this entire universe consists of one universal energy which makes this universe work. This entire universe consists of 84,00,000 species. These 84,00,000 species works with this universal energy . The energy that works in human beings is known as Kundalini Energy, Soul Energy, Spirit Energy or also known as Shakti as written in our Vedas. So, this Kundalini energy is a part of this universal energy.&nbsp;<br />
For eg. Electrical energy is one. The different electrical appliances uses this one electrical energy in different manner according to their work.&nbsp;<br />
This Kundalini energy in human beings internally works in different ways. As we know and also written in our Vedas, this entire human body whether gross or subtle is made of five elements known as Sky, Air, Fire, Water and Earth. The energies corresponding to these five elements are present at different centres in our body known as Chakras as said in Vedas, also known as Energy Centres. These energies are responsible for the working of this physical body.&nbsp;<br />
In this body, we have different energy centres, out of which seven are main, known as chakras, also known as Energy centres. In these seven Chakras, first five chakras correspond to these five elements . These seven chakras are present in the Sushumna nadi also known as Energy Channel along the spinal cord.&nbsp;<br />
Our First Chakra is Mooladhara Chakra, which corresponds to Earth Energy, Here, Kundalini Energy is connected with Earth Energy and is present at the base of spinal cord.<br />
Our Second Chakra is Swadhisthana Chakra, which corresponds to Water Energy, Here Kundalini Energy is connected with Water Energy and is present below navel and above pubic bone.<br />
Third Chakra is Manipura Chakra, where Kundalini energy is connected with fire energy and is present in navel region. Fourth Chakra is Anahata Chakra, here with Air energy it is present in heart region. Fifth Chakra is Vishudha Chakra, where it is connected with air energy in throat region.&nbsp;<br />
In Sixth Chakra Ajna Chakra, it is connected with sixth sense. And in Seventh Chakra Shasrara Chakra, it is connected with Universal energy or Shiva. &nbsp;<br />
This Kundalini energy remains blocked in these chakras, around 70-80% remains blocked. With other 20-30%, human body works. With the help of Kundalini Yog Sadhana, we unblock this energy so that it can rise up. Energy is already present inside but it is sleeping , with the help of sadhana we awaken this energy.<br />
Now, What is Kundalini Yoga? Yog means union. Here, word union implies when this Kundalini Energy unites with Universal Energy. That is when it reaches Sahasrara Chakra, in other words when Shakti connects with Siva, it is union. This is Kundalini Yoga.<br />
Once, Kundalini energy which is present in human beings comes in connection with Universal energy, all of a sudden &nbsp;it attains a great power. The power attained is such that nothing remains impossible for the person in this universe. Then he attains the stage where he says,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम्।<br />
cidānandarūpaḥ śivo&#39;ham śivo&#39;ham.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From his life, permanently all sorrows, grieves, complaints, sadness, negativity, fear etc.. diminishes and he attains peace, bliss in his life forever.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, to reach this stage, we here at Om Yoga, teach &nbsp;theoretically and practically many diffrenent &nbsp;techniques of this sadhana like Asanas, Pranayama(Breathing Teechniques), Bandhas, Mudras, Shatkriyas, Chakras Beej Mantra Sadhana, Chakras Symbol Sadhana, Chakras Healing etc.. &nbsp;in 11 days, 50 hours. How to Practice, what is required for this practice, what cautions to be taken while doing this sadhana, limitations of this practice. This teaching of 11 days 50 hours has to be carried in your daily routine as it requires a daily practice.Its practice continues till the time you reach your destination.</p>

<p><span style="color:#3498db;"><u><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Benefits of Kundalini Yoga</strong></span></u></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kundalini Yoga as taught by <span style="color:#3498db;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Yogi Bhajan</span></span></span> is the Yoga of Awareness. Kundalini Yoga gives you tools to expedite your spiritual growth and healing. Kundalini Yoga also provides physiological as well as psychological well-known benefits such as increased flexibility, expanded lung capacity, a strong core, and stress alleviation and much more. In our body, we have different types of energy present related to five elements and then sixth sense and atlast, universal&nbsp;energy. By doing Kundalini Yog sadhana, these energies(earth energy, water energy, fire energy, air energy and sky energy) increase which were blocked in their respective centres one by one and then, sixth sense unblocks and atlast, our&nbsp;energy unites with universal energy. When all these energies gets unblocked, we start receiving benefits of each and every energy correspondingly which is infinite in number.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are mentioned some more benefits of Kundalini Yoga:&nbsp;<br />
1.<strong>Inner Guidance:</strong> Kundalini Yoga develops the power of the intuitive mind. When you clean out the subconscious mind and learn to listen through deep meditation, when your thoughts and feelings resonate with the soul, you can sense the guidance of intuition that is always present.<br />
2.<strong>Protection from negativity:</strong> Kundalini Yoga practice fortifies and expands your electromagnetic field, or aura. It is the energy field that surrounds you, and that alerts you to positive and negative influences in your environment. A weak aura can let in negative influences, and even attract them. A big, strong, bright aura can protect you from negativity and keep you centered in the light of your true identity.<br />
3.<strong>Emotional Balance and neutral mind: </strong>&nbsp;Kundalini Yoga strengthens the nervous system, balances the glands, purifies the blood, and cleans out subconscious thought patterns. This gives you greater awareness and ability to choose how you respond to your thoughts and feelings. Through practice, you can train your mind and body not to react emotionally&mdash;not by repressing emotions, but by developing a buffer zone, a time and space in which to process and make conscious choices about your responses.<br />
Develop the neutral mind, the place where the positive and the negative are evaluated in an instant, and you can act from that state of non-attachment, compassion, and neutrality. Act, don&rsquo;t react.<br />
4.&nbsp;<strong>Deep Relaxation That Heals</strong>: Kundalini Yoga practice helps you to becomes physically and mentally relaxed and also teaches you to self-heal yourself with this.<br />
5.&nbsp;<strong>Befriend your soul and manifest your destiny:</strong> Kundalini Yoga gives you an experience of who you are when the grip of ego is released. It allows the depth of the soul to be felt and known. Begin to access your truth and create a strong connection to your soul and your soul&rsquo;s work in this lifetime.<br />
<br />
Kundalini Yoga is an experience of uniting the finite self with the Infinite. Once you gain this experience, you no longer have the need to look for your security outside of yourself. Your security comes from knowing who you are in relation to the Universe. You know who you are, and you can be you. You can leave the pain of past wounds behind, and manifest your soul&rsquo;s destiny.</p>

I had a habit of taking drugs but after studying the course, i really changed my habits to Sattvic. Also, what we all use to feel that happiness is something that comes from outer world. Here, I learned what is true happiness? Now, i can say and can feel that i am very happy and can feel happiness from inside  and doesnot require outer things to keep me happy.</p>

Before 5 years, i suffered from Diabetes and due to this, i underwent a lot of stress. i could feel everytime i use to hide my real self. I could never express myself the way i am. This very thing always made me feel not good. After completing the yoga course, i was able to recognise and accept real me and could question myself as a neutral person. This was so superb that i started dealing with my problems so nicely. This was the first thing that helped me here to overcome my stress. The best lesson i learned in my Yoga course is Aparigraha. Have as much required. Ask yourself how much you require rather than working unconsciously.  I was able to manage my stress effectively.I was deeply benefitted by this program as i learned the right way of living a life.</p>

This course helped me to face myself deeply that how negative i am. But, yes this also helped me to become positive. Learning Yoga here helped me to learn to accept the things as they are. The best part of this course was i could meet Ruchika Sensei, whose lessons had a great impact on my mind. It was great and fantastic to take lectures of her.

But now, after completing the course, I can say clearly ,”Yoga is life” because yoga focuses on our body and mind and more than that, inner self. At last, I can only say that my life changed, and sparked by understanding Yoga, and meeting so nice Yoga teachers of OmYoga</p>

                    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>I completed my 200 Hour Yoga TTC course in the month of August 2017. I was able to meet so kind people here. Here, I learnt how body, mind and breath are connected with each other. Yoga is not merely asanas. Doing asanas, by connecting mind with body helps in achieving better pose.  I learnt from here,"“Don’t make the problem bigger by yourself.” This is what I learned from teacher Ruchika Saran. “Be satisfied with what you have now.” “You become far from happiness if you are focusing on past or future.”
“Find happiness from where you are, be responsible for yourself, choose to be better.” These are golden things i have learned from here.

<div class="footer-logo" style="text-align:justify"><strong>OM YOGA &ndash; believes in making complete and perfect Yoga Instructor acc. to Yoga of Indian Traditiion.</strong> So, if you are looking for becoming a complete and perfect Yoga instructor, then you are at a right place. Yoga which was born in India in Sanskrit language many centuries before whose date and time cannot be specified as it is present since the beginning of this universe, whose base was Ashtanga Yoga and Hatha Yoga written in Patanjali Yog Darshan, Hatha Yog Pradipika, Gheranda Samhita, Siva Samhita etc. is a very deep knowledge like an ocean. It is so deep that nothing in this world is impossible with Yoga. The impossible word here signifies whatever requirements human being has in this world like respect, position, health, wealth, success, love, beauty, fearless, physically and mentally strong, peace, bliss, in overall all achievements on this planet that human being wants to have , there is nothing that cannot be achieved through Yoga. &nbsp;<strong>There is no word like Impossible with Yoga because Yoga means UNION which means becoming one. And this is practically experienced by our Yogis.</strong> And this is the reason why people travel to India to study Yoga specifically as India has gained its special position in this world with the name of Yoga, and has also been declared as, &rdquo;World Guru&rdquo;.<br />
But, we can see that in this present time there are more than thousands of Yoga centres all over the India who say that they teach Yoga but seeing in reality, we can feel and see that traditional yoga is getting lost because modern people who are coming forth in this field themselves have no actual understanding about Yoga as they cannot study Sanskrit language so, unable to understand real Yoga. So, these people have restricted the meaning of Yoga only to Asanas. After Asanas, people do not go beyond because they do not there is something beyond this also. Which is totally wrong. Yoga is something different. It is a complete path in itself. Asanas is just one part of Yoga but not a complete path. So, it can be seen Yoga has just become a fun in present time. If we talk to people for Yoga, they have only two things to speak about, one is regarding Asanas and another how to cure diseases that is therapy. Nothing beyond this. So, it is very pathetic to see how Yoga is loosing its real meaning.<br />
<strong>We, here at Om Yoga focus on this real Indian Traditional Yoga along with Sanskrit language present the same to people in English.</strong>(we have facilities for the translator for those people who have problem in understanding English). This makes our place unique place to study Yoga which is rarely available in other places. And we have succeded in achieving 99% results in spreading this knowledge. Our students feel this thing after they come to Om Yoga. They say that they had no idea Yoga is something beyond asanas also. They understand the real meaning of Yoga here and specially come to teach Traditional Yogic concepts here with us. And feel happy while they leave the centre. Our Traditional Yogic concepts help them in changing their life and come out of stress. For more info, you can visit our page of <a href="yoga-student-review.html">STUDENT REVIEWS</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>We can see that present time has become a very struggle full time for human being to survive on this planet because of increasing competition and desires and instability in relationships and emotions.</strong> To fulfil his desires and to be ahead in the race of competition, he is working day to night to achieve that and has just become like a machine where he has just forgotted the words like happiness, joy, calmness, relaxation etc.. But still when he is unable to fulfil his desires, he feels unsatisfied. Because if seen in reality, there is no end to desires. Desires are unlimited and no one ever can make the desires fulfilled. But we never understand this and are keen on fulfilling them. And when unable to fulfil, feel sad and unsatisfied, Because of that he gets demoralized and turns negative. This negative thinking then brings him under peer pressure feeling himself responsible for not being able to do what he wants. This then results in a lot of stress, tension, depression and anxiety. Now, when he is full of stress and anxiety, unable to sleep properly, then to come out of all this, he chooses an other path to make mind calm. For that, he starts taking a drink, smoke, drugs etc... Slowly and gradually, he becomes addicted to all this. The result of all this is that the person then suffers physically also. Because this path is not a permanent and correct way to get out of stress. But, because of lack of understanding at that time, he is unable to understand all this. So, he suffers from physical and mental illness. And hence his entire life is ruined.<br />
<strong>We, here with the help of Asanas and Pranayama help the person to recover from physical illness</strong> and become physically strong and is a preparation for becoming mentally strong. <strong>And with the help of our Yogic Philosophy, we help to recover from mental illness by changing the perspective of thinking for life.</strong> This helps them to have a positive look at life AND BE HAPPY and real solution to all the problems of life by his own. So, he becomes mentally strong. And we are happy to say that we have achieved 100% results in this. Because students who come to study at our centre, have experienced it and benefitted from this and have learned the, &rdquo;ART OF LIVING&rdquo; at our centre. <strong>This is what is real Yoga, that teaches us ART OF LIVING.</strong><br />
<strong>So, if you are really looking for this studies of real Yoga, you are invited to join us and get benefitted and spread the real knowledge to others also. Studying here helps you to gain more confidence at your knowledge and spread the right and useful knowledge amongst others.</strong></div>
