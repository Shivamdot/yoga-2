				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>This 300hour Yoga Teacher Training provides a complete confidence to a person. We have seen nowadays many people complete their yoga courses, also have degrees but still  their knowledges are incomplete and there is no confidence in them inside to teach others. They have a confused mindset yet. But we here at Om Yoga have framed our courses keeping in mind each and every small point of these people too that after completion, there is no feeling of incompletion inside. Specially, most of the people seen nowadays feel they cannot do Yoga because they have no flexible bodies or suffer from some physical problem. And so feel demotivated for doing Yoga. But our courses are planned in a proper planned manner that anyone can do these courses. We have made different series of Asanas(around 6) , Pranayama(around 4) and philosophy too(Philosophy we teach from very basic level). Our series are designed very systematically from basic level to advanced level. We start teaching from basic series and week by week, slowly and gradually take to advanced series. In this method, even those people who have less flexibility or any physical problem, also can do easily without facing much exertion physically or mentally. And those who say we cannot do Yoga because of less flexibility they come to the point where they can even do advanced level too.This builds confidence in them upon what they have studied. As rather than touching the modern studies of Yoga, we start from very traditional concepts. Like for eg. if you want to control entire tree and start to touch leaves of a tree, you cannot hold entire tree. But if you hold root part of a tree, entire tree comes under your control . SImilarly, here also by touching root of Yoga you can understand the entire world of Yoga. And this makes you more stronger in your knowledge and can understand all the concepts of Yoga.</span></p>
