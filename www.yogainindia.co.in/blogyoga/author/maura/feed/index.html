				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I am from Germany, I attended the Kundalini TTC. It was a wish from heart to learn that knowledge, and even it was a short course (50hours), but all the knowledge was teached to me what is important to know, in theory and practical lessons. The teachers are very nice and they teach from heart. Also they are nice in person and take care of you, if you feel comfortable with everything. The room is very nice and all the Ashram, with Ganga view and nice people and good indian food. I am very thankful for my experience and I will always come back for drop in class or any course.</strong></p>
