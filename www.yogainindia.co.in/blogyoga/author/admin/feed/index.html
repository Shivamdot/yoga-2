				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yogic Diet &#8211; Wholesome and Vegetarian</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“susnigdhamadhuraharascaturthamsavivarjitah |</em></strong><br />
<strong><em> Bhujyate sivasamprityai mitaharah sa ucyate||”…(Hatha Yog Pradipika)</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is said that ,” Eating sweet, unctuous food offered to the Almighty leaving one-quarter of stomach empty is Mitahara.”<br />
To really understand Yoga&#8217;s approach to diet you must familiarize yourself with its effect on the mind and body:<br />
I. Sattvic foods are pure and health promoting, (sattva-quality of love, light and life)<br />
II. Rajastic foods are stimulating (Rajas-quality of activity and passion, lacking stability)<br />
III. Tamastic foods are impure (Tamas-the quality of darkness and inertia, dragging us into ignorance and attachment).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I. Sattvic Food:</strong><br />
The yogic-diet is lacto-vegetarian, which means that it is made up entirely of non-animal foods. Evidence suggests that a predominantly vegetarian diet is good for our health. Yogic diet consists of pure, simple, natural foods that are easily digested and promote health. Simple meals help easier and faster digestion and assimilation of foods. The premise is that, such a diet being healthy, it will help develop a stronger body and a calmer, more peaceful state of mind with a balanced flow of energy between them.<br />
Sattvic diet is the most suitable one for any serious student of Yoga. More importantly, as a Yogic diet has a very high nutritional value, the food is also rich in Prana or vital energy. When you feel the upsurge of life force as a result of this diet, you will understand why the sages said, &#8220;You are what you eat.&#8221;Food should be organically grown if possible, and free of preservatives and additives.<br />
Saltvic foods include: cereals and whole meal bread, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, seeds and grains, sprouted seeds, dried peas, lentils and beans, honey, pure natural fruit juices, herbal tea, pure water etc…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>II. Rajastic Food:</strong><br />
Rajastic foods make people physically more active, but over the long term too many Rajastic foods may over stimulate the body, excite the passions and make the mind restless. Rajastic foods feed the body at the expense of the mind; they destroy the mind-body equilibrium. Rajastic foods are stimulating; very hot, spicy, dry, salty, stale etc. Even eating in a hurry is considered Rajastic.<br />
Rajastic foods include: non- vegetarian food like fish, meet etc.., eggs, hot substances, such as sharp spices or strong herbs, stimulants such as coffee, teas and cola drinks, too much salt, chocolate, onion and garlic, cayenne peppers, turmeric, curry powder etc…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>III. Tamastic Food</strong><br />
Tamastic diet benefits neither the mind nor the body. Prana is withdrawn, powers of reasoning become clouded and a sense of inertia sets in. The body&#8217;s resistance to disease is destroyed and the mind is filled with dark emotions, such as anger and greed. Tamastic foods are bad smelly, left-over, stored, spoiled, burnt, tasteless or impure etc&#8230; Foods that are factory farmed or highly processed would be considered tamastic. Overeating is also considered Tamastic.<br />
Tamastic foods include: alcohol and tobacco, fermented foods such as vinegar, stale overripe substances, processed food, canned and packaged food, junk food, pickled and salted foods, stored non-vegetarian food like chicken, fish, mutton etc&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>This 300hour Yoga Teacher Training provides a complete confidence to a person. We have seen nowadays many people complete their yoga courses, also have degrees but still  their knowledges are incomplete and there is no confidence in them inside to teach others. They have a confused mindset yet. But we here at Om Yoga have framed our courses keeping in mind each and every small point of these people too that after completion, there is no feeling of incompletion inside. Specially, most of the people seen nowadays feel they cannot do Yoga because they have no flexible bodies or suffer from some physical problem. And so feel demotivated for doing Yoga. But our courses are planned in a proper planned manner that anyone can do these courses. We have made different series of Asanas(around 6) , Pranayama(around 4) and philosophy too(Philosophy we teach from very basic level). Our series are designed very systematically from basic level to advanced level. We start teaching from basic series and week by week, slowly and gradually take to advanced series. In this method, even those people who have less flexibility or any physical problem, also can do easily without facing much exertion physically or mentally. And those who say we cannot do Yoga because of less flexibility they come to the point where they can even do advanced level too.This builds confidence in them upon what they have studied. As rather than touching the modern studies of Yoga, we start from very traditional concepts. Like for eg. if you want to control entire tree and start to touch leaves of a tree, you cannot hold entire tree. But if you hold root part of a tree, entire tree comes under your control . SImilarly, here also by touching root of Yoga you can understand the entire world of Yoga. And this makes you more stronger in your knowledge and can understand all the concepts of Yoga.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We can see that present time is a very struggle full time for human being to survive on this planet because of increasing competition and desires and instability in relationships and emotions. To fulfil his desires and to be ahead in the race of competition, he is working day to night to achieve that and has just become like a machine where he has just forgotted the words like happiness, joy, calmness, relaxation etc.. But still when he is unable to fulfil his desires, he feels unsatisfied. Because if seen in reality, there is no end to desires. Desires are unlimited and no one ever can make the desires fulfilled. But we never understand this and are keen on fulfilling them. And when unable to fulfil, feel sad and unsatisfied, Because of that he gets demoralized and turns negative. This negative thinking then brings him under peer pressure feeling himself responsible for not being able to do what he wants. This then results in a lot of stress, tension, depression and anxiety. Now, when he is full of stress and anxiety, unable to sleep properly, then to come out of all this, he chooses an other path to make mind calm. For that, he starts taking a drink, smoke, drugs etc&#8230; Slowly and gradually, he becomes addicted to all this. The result of all this is that the person then suffers physically also. Because this path is not a permanent and correct way to get out of stress. But, because of lack of understanding at that time, he is unable to understand all this. So, he suffers from physical and mental illness. And hence his entire life is ruined.<br />
<img class=" wp-image-121 aligncenter" src="https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/necessity-of-yoga-2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="190" srcset="https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/necessity-of-yoga-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/necessity-of-yoga-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/necessity-of-yoga-2-750x422.jpg 750w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/necessity-of-yoga-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><br />
We, here with the help of Asanas and Pranayama help the person to recover from physical illness and become physically strong and is a preparation for becoming mentally strong. And with the help of our Yogic Philosophy, we help to recover from mental illness by changing the perspective of thinking for life. This helps them to have a positive look at life AND BE HAPPY and real solution to all the problems of life by his own. So, he becomes mentally strong. And we are happy to say that we have achieved 100% results in this. Because students who come to study at our centre, have experienced it and benefitted from this and have learned the, ”ART OF LIVING” at our centre. This is what is real Yoga, that teaches us ART OF LIVING.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this world, there are different variety of people who do not have clear understanding about Yoga. So, they have given their own definitions to Yoga. Some say Yoga is Asanas, some say it is Asanas and Pranayama both, some say it is for physical fitness, many others say it is for both physical and mental fitnessThere are many different concepts of Yoga going nowadays, some say Yoga is exercise, some say it is a religion, many say it is a philosophy while some others say it is for mental peace and many others say it is just an idea. Some other people say it is totally a different concept. But what actually Yoga is? Let us see.</p>
<p><strong>Actually, The word Yoga has come from the Sanskrit word many centuries before, “YUJ” which means union</strong>. It is something that brings you to reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now, what is the meaning of word, Union?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Yoga, word Union is used in 3 places: physically(body), mentally(mind) and spiritually(soul).<br />
</strong>Yoga has basically two paths: Bhavana Yoga(1. Gyan Yoga, 2. Bhakti Yoga, 3. Karma Yoga) and Prana samya mana Yoga(1. Ashtanga Yoga, 2. Hatha Yoga).  Rest all other types of Yoga that are going nowadays have come from the Ashtanga Yoga and Hatha Yoga like Kundalini Yoga is a part of Hatha Yoga only and Raja Yoga also came from Ashtanga Yoga, etc&#8230; The Yoga that are prevailing nowadays like Red Yoga, Hot Yoga, Power Yoga, Sun Yoga, Moon Yoga, etc&#8230; is not complete Yoga. The people have taken only Asanas from Yoga and have given different variations to that and named different types in that. But these are not complete Yoga. It is only based on Asanas.</p>
<p>Here, our main focus is on Pranasamya mana Yoga. Because Bhavana Yoga tends to be more religious rather than Pranasamyamana Yoga. So, for nowadays, this type of Yoga is more popular because it is not bounded in religions. There is no word like religion mentioned in this type of yoga as in Bhavana Yoga. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are 3 types of people in this world: Sattvic, Rajastic and Tamastic. So, Pranasamyamana Yoga is followed by these 3 types of people depending upon what suits their mental level. Those who follow spiritual path are pure sattvic, those who follow mental path, are both sattvic and rajastic mixed, and those who follow the path of physical path are mixed rajastic and tamastic.</strong></p>
<p>There are different definitions of this word:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Yoga, with the help of Asanas, we connect mind with the body.</li>
<li>With the help of Pranayama, we connect mind and breath.</li>
<li>With the help of meditation, we tend to connect ourselves with soul.</li>
<li>And with deep meditation(Samadhi), we tend to have self-realization. The meaning of word self here is only soul. And meaning of self-realization is to realize, “I am peace, bliss, joy, energy”. Entire universe is one. I am in everyone and everyone is in me.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>THIS IS UNION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall all types of Yoga target physically, mentally and spiritually.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are physical benefits of Yoga?</strong></p>
<p><strong>With the help of Asanas, we connect mind with this body. </strong>Mind which is so disturbed because of too much stress in modern life that it is not aware is not conscious about this physical body. Because of no relaxation , mind is always wondering outside. So when we do Asanas, we focus our mind on stretches of body, breath and then maintaining the final position of asana for a little longer time, our mind acquires stability. With the help of which, our mind becomes conscious of this physical body which helps in healing the body just merely by concentrating on it. Whatever problems we have in our body, those problems gets healed by developing concentration upon them. So, Asanas help in solving physical ailments, increasing stamina and patience, helps to increase concentration, positivity, stability and flexibility. Makes our skin more brighter by purifying the blood inside. Tones up all the internal organs and muscles of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Benefits of Yoga</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mental benefits are achieved more by Pranayama. With the help of Pranayama, our mind focuses on breath, Mind which has a direct connection with breath. By controlling breath, we control mind and by controlling mind, we control breath.</strong></p>
<p>So, in Pranayama, by doing different breathing exercises, by concentrating on breath in them, we tend to control mind by controlling the breath. And by controlling mind, all activities of life comes under our control, we are no longer slave to this mind. As we want, we can live our life as we have capability to control our feelings, emotions, our thought process. This makes our life more happier and peaceful. With the help of this, person learns “Art of Living” only by merely controlling the mind. This is what each and every person requires in their life.</p>
<p>This is one of the main topic in all our Yoga Courses that we emphasize upon and teach each and every person who comes to study Yoga here to teach them, Art of Living.</p>
<p>Spiritual Benefits of Yoga</p>
<p>There are no words to list spiritual benefits of Yoga. Because it is a state of deep meditation and samadhi, where person becomes silent, as there are no physical and mental activities at that stage. Mental level becomes empty at that stage. So, when yogi reaches this stage, there is no mind at that stage to experience what feelings he has there, yogi there experiences everything in his soul. So, because there is no mind at that stage, one cannot explain that stage. Because for explanation, mind is required, feelings are experienced by mind but this stage mind is empty so one cannot list the experience. That is why spiritual path is a very deep path. One cannot explain that, so we are not listing it in detail here because it only our own experience that we have which can be only transferred through feelings and not through words.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-42" src="http://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/234-300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/234-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/234-768x440.jpg 768w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/234-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://www.yogainindia.co.in/blogyoga/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/234-750x430.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
